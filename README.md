# About

Tvrtl is a gambling simulation where users wager tokens on the outcome of a turtle's random path from the center of an $n$-sided polygon toward its edges. This path is generated using the concept of [Brownian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion), and these points are smoothened using [spline curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)) from three.js. See a demo of the app in action below along with instructions on how to run it. Check out the repository Wiki for more information.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
